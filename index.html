      <h1>On Paper</h1>
      <h2>by Jacqueline Woodson</h2>
    <p>The first time I write my full name <br>
        Jacqueline Amanda Woodson <br> 
        without anybody's help <br> 
        on a clean white page <br> 
        in my composition notebook, <br> 
        I know <br>
         if I wanted to <br> 
         I could write anything. <br> 
         Letters becoming words, <br> 
         words gathering meaning, <br> 
         becoming thoughts outside my head <br>
        becoming sentences written <br> 
        by Jacqueline Amanda Woodson</p>
